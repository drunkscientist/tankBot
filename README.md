i upgraded my 3d printer with ramps so i had an extra board laying around i wanted to do something with. so i decided to put it in a cigar box along with 4 spare stepper motors i had, and printed some mecanum wheels for it, along with a few spare 18650s for power. serial commands tell the wheels to move, and will be partnered with an esp-cam with some modified firmware for control and vision. should actually be useful for inspection underneath vehicles, or similar ground crawling needs
